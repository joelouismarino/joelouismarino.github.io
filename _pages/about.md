I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computation and Neural Systems](http://www.cns.caltech.edu) program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I am co-advised by Professors [Pietro Perona](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/people.html) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/about.php).

## Research Focus

My goal is to create machines that are able to learn to perform tasks through observing and interacting with their environments. Toward this end, I have focused on connecting ideas from *predictive coding* (in theoretical neuroscience) with modern *deep generative models* and *deep reinforcement learning*.
