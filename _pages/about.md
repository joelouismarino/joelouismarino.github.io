I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com) based in London, UK. I received my Ph.D. from the [Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns) program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I was co-advised by Professors [Pietro Perona](http://www.vision.caltech.edu) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/about.php).

## Research Focus

My goal is to create machines that are able to learn to perform tasks through observing and interacting with their environments. Toward this end, my research has focused on the intersection between machine learning, Bayesian probability theory, theoretical neuroscience, control theory, and other adjacent areas. In my [PhD thesis](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14178/1/joseph_marino_Caltech_PhD_Thesis.pdf), I investigated unifying themes across these areas through the lens of feedback and feedforward computational processing.
